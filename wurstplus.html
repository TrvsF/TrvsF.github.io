        <span style="font-size: .9em; font-family: 'henryblue';">a trio of minecraft mods that would aid in a subset of servers featuring
         'crystal pvp'. each was written in java, using gradle as a buildtool & mixins to inject code at runtime,
           by myself.

            the final instalment of the trilogy, made alongside <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/madmegsox1">madmeg</a>
             & a bunch of other contributers that you can find on the github. this version was the first to
              be (almost) always full open source & therefore featured lots of realse trouble due to my
               inexperience. in the end, however, this version was the one where i understood the most what i was
                doing, though i was getting sick of minecraft at this point.

            every 'good' minecraft mod needs a good sequel. this realse featured some cool ideas, a pasted gui, & lots
             of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4D-FF2BQE80&t=173s">controversy</a>. this was probably the
              'best' instalment, mostly due to the speed i was working, the fun i was having, & fairly fast pace
               the meta was shifting.

            the one i had saved to my google drive so i could work on it at school. this was really me learning java &
             minecraft mod devolopment. this project is riddled with a bunch of 'pasted' code, mainly in the
              api section & gui.
